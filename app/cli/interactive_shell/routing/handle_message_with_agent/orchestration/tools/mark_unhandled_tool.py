"""``mark_unhandled`` pseudo-tool for partial-handling signalling.

This tool produces no terminal side effects. It exists solely so the LLM
planner can flag — in the same tool-call response — that some clause of
the user's request could not be mapped to an executable tool. OpenAI and
OpenAI-compatible providers clear the free-text body whenever a model
emits ``tool_calls``, so the previous "UNHANDLED:" plain-text convention
silently dropped whenever the planner also matched at least one valid
tool. Routing that signal through a dedicated tool keeps the structured
contract intact while still letting the LLM ship the matched action.

The planner detects calls to this tool in
:func:`llm_action_planner._parse_tool_plan` and sets
``has_unhandled`` accordingly; no executable action is appended.
